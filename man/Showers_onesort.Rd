Results of the Showers card sort task for a single participant.
}
\description{
This dataset contains the results of the Showers card sort task for a single participant. The example comes from Showers, Abramson and Hogan (1998). The original paper contains some self-complexity indices for this example (Phi, proportion positive, proportion negative), and additional ones (e.g. H) are reported in Showers & Zeiger-Hill (2003).
